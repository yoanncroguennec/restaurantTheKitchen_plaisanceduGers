    "textPresentation": "We’d like to introduce ourselves, we're Leigh and Robert.\n\n We've been based in the mountains of southern France since 2005.\n\n I, Leigh, worked in private catering in the Alps for 3 years before moving south and running my own restaurant. Over the years, I have worked in the kitchen with many chefs (French, British, Italian, and Spanish) and have loved learning from them. Robert is a classically trained chef who ran his own hotel for 16 years before joining me for new adventures.\n\n The opportunity to swap the mountains for a life among the vineyards presented itself earlier this year, and we can't wait to introduce you to some of our favourite dishes, drawn not only from the mountains but also from our travels.\n\n We hope you enjoy your time with us.",
